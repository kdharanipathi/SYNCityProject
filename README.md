## Project Info

SynCity is an educational, interactive, visual novel-style game made for a UCSD SYN 100 Final Project. The game is targeted at middle and high school-age students.

The player becomes the Mayor of SynCity, a quickly-developing town centered around a core water resouces, Lake Inferior. The player's goal is to choose between good, bad, and okay strategies to guide SynCity towards sustainable, environmentally-concious development.

The game contains a non-linear descision path where their choices impact the environment and visually demonstrate the benefits of environmentally-concious policy.
